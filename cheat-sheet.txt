This is my cheat sheet

pwd = where am I?
ls = list of the directory I am
cd = change directory
cd ~ = change directory to home folder
cd .. = one directory up
touch = create file with no text in it
mkdir = create directory (folder)
echo = create file with text in it
> = redirect
cat = show the content of a file
code = open visual studio code
| (pipe) = add two different commands
ALWAYS DO pwd TO BE SURE WHERE I AM
